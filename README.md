# things todo

- software calibration of motor endpoints
- make sure to clamp target_count to endpoints to prevent movement past brake bias bar's "safe zone"

- add jitter protection for potentiometer
- refactor ugly poop code
- make potentiometer's adc to count function wiring agonistic
- find a way to make program step resolution and analog read resolution agonistic


- implement write to SD for persistent storage of important data (like motor endpoints)
- implement read from SD to restore previous values

- assuming software calibration implementation is done, implement a pseudo way of triggering calibration upon button press
- implement a screen UI for that too

- most important: review for logic bugs
